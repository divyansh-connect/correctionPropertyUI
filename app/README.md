```

## ⚙️ Backend API Configuration

By default, the application resolves the backend API endpoint dynamically:
- **iOS Simulator**: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`
- **Android Emulator**: `http://10.0.2.2:5000/api/v1`
- **Physical Device**: Update the host in `app/src/api/client.ts` to your machine's local Wi-Fi IP address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.X:5000/api/v1`) to connect successfully from your mobile device.
