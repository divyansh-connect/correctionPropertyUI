## 🔄 Core Business Workflows

### 1. Pricing Plan Checkout Workflow (Landing Page)
1. **Plan Selection**: User browses pricing options on the public Landing Page and clicks **Buy Now**.
2. **Checkout Modal**: Opens an interactive modal prompting for contact and payment information (Credit Card / Bank Account).
3. **Simulated Loader**: Displays progress spinners and animations during checkout.
4. **Success Redirect**: Automatically redirects the user to the `/login` screen to set up their workspace.

### 2. User Management Workflow (Manager/Admin Portal)
1. **Invite Modal**: Manager clicks "Invite User" which opens a React Form Modal (replacing native browser alerts).
2. **Inline Action Toggles**: 
   - **View Details**: View permissions and activities.
   - **Suspend / Activate**: Instantly toggles the status badge of the user.
   - **Revoke**: Prompts with a Confirm Dialog and deletes the user from the active directory.

### 3. Tenant Portal Document Upload
1. **Dropzone Interface**: Tenant clicks on the drag-and-drop area.
2. **File Explorer**: Triggered automatically via a hidden file input to browse local computer files. Selecting a file auto-populates the document title.
3. **Categories & Custom Category**:
   - Selector choices: *Rental Agreement, Identity Proof (Govt ID), Proof of Income, Utility Bills, Renter's Insurance, and Other*.
   - Selecting **Other** opens a text input to write a custom category name.
4. **5MB Validation**: The interface limits file size alerts up to 5MB, hiding unnecessary size sliders.

### 4. Tenant Payments and Balance Check
1. **Payments Page**: The tenant visits their payments tab.
2. **Outstanding Rent Check**:
   - If balance is **$0.00**, a green success check icon appears.
   - The "Pay Rent" action changes to a disabled **No Balance Due** outline button to prevent redundant payments.
   - If a balance exists, the tenant can complete the transaction online.

### 5. Owner Portal Property Management
1. **Add Property**: Owner clicks **+ Add Property**, opening a Modal form to set Property Name, Address, Type, and Target Rent.
2. **Delete Property**: Next to the details button is a Red Trash button. Clicking it triggers a **Confirm Dialog** before purging the property.

### 6. Owner Portal Document Upload
1. **Dropzone Interaction**: Opens file browser upon click.
2. **Owner Categories**: *Statements, Tax Documents, Contracts, Insurance, Property Photos, Maintenance Reports, Inspection Reports, and Other*. Selecting **Other** prompts for a custom name.
3. **Storage Sync**: Successfully uploaded files immediately appear in the owner's central Documents list.
